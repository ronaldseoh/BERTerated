"""An implementation of the Federated Averaging algorithm.

This is intended to be a minimal stand-alone implementation of Federated
Averaging, suitable for branching as a starting point for algorithm
modifications; see `tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process` for a
more full-featured implementation.

Based on the paper:

Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data
